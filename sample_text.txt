Welcome to OpenAI's Text-to-Speech demo.

This is a sample text file that demonstrates how to convert written text into natural-sounding speech using OpenAI's TTS API.

The API supports multiple voices and can handle various types of content, from short messages to longer articles. You can choose different voices to match your needs, whether you want a neutral, male, or female voice.

Text-to-speech technology has many practical applications, including accessibility features, audiobook creation, virtual assistants, and language learning tools.

This sample demonstrates the basic functionality. Feel free to replace this text with your own content!
